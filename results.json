Whether that be a partner, a friend, a family member, or even a baby sitter if that's possible.  Its important to take time to rest and recharge an nurture yourself, whether that be a nap, a bubble bath, a walk or whatever has made you feel good in the past.\nseeker\n- Utterance: Thank you, I hope so too. Yes I have my husband helping me. I am a stay at home mom while he goes to work. Im lucky that I am able to stay home with our son but at the same time its hard because because theres a less opportunity to have a break and on top of that he works 12 hour shifts so I rarley get to spend time with my husband.\nseeker\n- Utterance: I took my first break 2 days ago with my husband.
